				Imagine a tomorrow where you are part of the circle of life and the well-being of nature is
				also your well-being. You are not taking away the opportunities for a good life for others
				near or far, now or in the future. You belong to a community of your choice that cares and
				supports, but is also part of a wider democratic society. You can slow down without feeling
				guilty about it.

			<h3>What is degrowth?</h3>
			<p>
				The <b>degrowth</b> movement brings together scientists, activists, artists and people concerned
				about the state of the world.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Degrowth</b> challenges the colonialist structures of Western development thinking and its
				dependence on continued economic growth.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Degrowth</b> creates a democratic society in which everyone has the opportunity to participate
				in deciding common issues.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Degrowth</b> does not spring from nowhere. There are many established self-sufficient communities
				and radical movements in the world from which degrowth learns and which it supports.
			</p>
			<p>
				In the global North, <b>degrowth</b> implies a major political and economic reorganisation, where
				energy and resource use is measured against the limits of the earth&#39;s carrying capacity.
